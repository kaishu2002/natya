This dance form was traditionally performed in temples and royal courts, often in praise of the deities. The delicate and flowing style of the dance was influenced by both the folk and classical traditions of Kerala.Over time, Mohiniyattam evolved, incorporating both Bharatanatyam and local dance traditions to create a distinct style.

Its name translates to "dance of the enchantress," reflecting the grace and allure of its movements. The dance has its roots in the ancient performing arts of Kerala and is traditionally performed by women. Mohiniyattam is characterized by its graceful, fluid movements, expressive gestures, and a distinct lyrical quality.

                Historically, Mohiniyattam was performed in temples as part of religious rituals and was an integral part of the traditional Kathakali repertoire.

The dance form combines elements of classical Indian dance with influences from regional folk traditions, creating a unique and captivating style.

The dance is accompanied by traditional Carnatic music, with a focus on vocal rendition and rhythmic patterns. Today, Mohiniyattam is celebrated for its aesthetic beauty and continues to be performed both in traditional settings and on global stages.
