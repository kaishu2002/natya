            <p class="lead">Bharatanatyam is one of the most ancient and prominent classical dance forms of India, originating from Tamil Nadu. Steeped in tradition, Bharatanatyam combines music, rhythm, and expression to narrate stories from Hindu mythology. The word "Bharatanatyam" is a compound of 'Bha', meaning Bhava (expression), 'Ra', meaning Raga (melody), 'Ta', meaning Tala (rhythm), and 'Natyam', meaning dance.</p>

            <h2 class="text-center">History</h2>
            <p class="lead">Bharatanatyam has a rich historical background, with roots tracing back over 2000 years. It was traditionally performed in the temples of Tamil Nadu by Devadasis, temple dancers dedicated to worship and service. Over time, it evolved into a sophisticated art form that is celebrated globally today.</p>
            <p>Bharatanatyam traces its origins over 2,000 years ago in the temples of Tamil Nadu. It was originally performed by Devadasis, women dedicated to serving temple deities through dance and music. These temple dancers were custodians of sacred dance rituals, offering their art as an expression of devotion.</p>
            <p>In the 19th and early 20th centuries, Bharatanatyam underwent a transformation. Visionary dancers like Rukmini Devi Arundale and Balasaraswati revived and modernized Bharatanatyam, bringing it from temples to theater stages, preserving its spiritual and artistic integrity. Today, it is celebrated worldwide as an essential part of India's cultural heritage.</p>
