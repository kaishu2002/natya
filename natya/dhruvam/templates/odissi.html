                <h2 class="text-center">Introduction</h2>
                <p class="">Odissi is one of the classical dance forms of India, originating from the eastern state of Odisha. It is known for its graceful movements, sculpturesque poses, and intricate footwork, often telling stories from Hindu mythology, particularly those of Lord Jagannath, an incarnation of Lord Vishnu. The dance combines both sensuous and spiritual elements, with a focus on expressing emotions (bhava) and devotion (bhakti) through gestures (mudras), facial expressions, and body movements.
                Traditionally, Odissi was performed in temples as a form of offering to the gods. The dance has evolved over centuries and is now a popular performance art on global stages, celebrated for its unique blend of movement, music, and storytelling.</p>
                <h2 class="text-center">History</h2>
                <p class="">Odissi, one of the oldest classical dance forms of India, originated in the temples of the eastern state of Odisha. It dates back to around the 2nd century BCE and was traditionally performed by maharis, the temple dancers, as a form of worship and devotion to Lord Jagannath. Odissi's fluidity and grace reflect the sculptures and poses seen in Odisha's ancient temples. Over time, with the decline of temple traditions, Odissi faced periods of neglect, but it was revived in the mid-20th century by dedicated artists and scholars. Today, Odissi is known for its expressive storytelling, intricate footwork, and sculpturesque body movements, preserving the rich cultural heritage of Odisha.</p>
                <p class=""> Over the centuries, the dance evolved through the Mahari tradition, where it was performed by temple dancers, and the Gotipua tradition, where young boys dressed as women would perform the dance in public spaces. With its graceful movements, intricate footwork, and expressive gestures, Odissi tells stories from Hindu mythology, particularly from the epics and the life of Lord Krishna. Revived in the 20th century after a period of decline under colonial rule, Odissi has regained its prominence as one of India's most cherished and elegant classical dance forms.</p>
                <h2 class="text-center">Style and Features</h2>
                <p class="">Odissi, one of the oldest classical dance forms in India, is deeply rooted in the traditions of the state of Odisha. Known for its graceful and lyrical movements, Odissi is characterized by its fluidity, intricate footwork, and expressive gestures that tell stories from Hindu mythology, particularly about Lord Jagannath.</p>
                    Mudras (Hand Gestures): Like other Indian classical dances, Odissi employs a variety of mudras to convey emotions and narratives, forming the language of storytelling.
                    Expressive Eye Movements: Abhinaya, or the art of expression, is a key element in Odissi. Dancers use their eyes and facial expressions to communicate emotions and enhance the narrative.
